Engine
------

The underlying Set engine has eight primary operations it executes:
    - Insert an object
    - Ignore an object
    - Create a subset query
    - Destroy a subset query
    - Execute a subset query
    - Changes since logical timestamp
    - Objects since logical timestamp
    - Execute third-party module

These operations are all that are needed to operate.
